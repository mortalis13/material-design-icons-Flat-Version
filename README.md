A flat version of the official [material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) library **v4.0.0** organized by icon names.  
Additionally, each icon size **[18, 24, 36, 48]** is put to a separate archive.

The repository includes the script used for the structure conversion, **android_icons_flatten.py**.  
It requieres 2 runs:

- with the `run()` method to generate new structure
- with the `run_zip()` method to create **zip** archives for each icon size
